### I'm Tyler! Welcome to my slice of the internet!  

I'm Tyler and here on my GitHub profile you'll find a wide variety of projects and code that's just as varied as my hobbies and interests. I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer who just wants to know how stuff works.  

Right now I'm:

- Unraveling the hidden layers of Bob Ross's *The Joy of Painting*

Some of my skills include:  
- Python  
- Tensorflow  
- Scikit-Learn  
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- FastAPI  
- Flask
- Natural Language Processing
